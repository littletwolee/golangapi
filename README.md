# A Restful Api Server for mongodb by golang Language

##Summary
At first, I'm only want to have a ejabberd+riak IM server. So I set up it on my vps.
And next, I want to modify some models of ejabberd. Like user info, relationship and so on. So, this api is a DB service. If you like it or you have some questions, Feel free to contact me

##include package
* [beego](http://beego.me/) -- A Restful framework
* [mgo](http://labix.org/mgo) -- MongoDB drive
